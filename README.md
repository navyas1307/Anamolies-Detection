# Banking Fraud Detection System

This is an end-to-end fraud detection system developed during a banking internship. It identifies suspicious financial transactions using a hybrid unsupervised learning approach, combining **Autoencoders** and **Isolation Forests**. The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and a real-time scoring API with dynamic threshold optimization.

## Project Highlights

- **Autoencoder + Isolation Forest ensemble** for improved anomaly detection.
- **80% Recall on actual fraud cases** with optimized precision-recall balance.
- **Robust Feature Engineering**: Velocity, deviation, rolling stats, merchant behavior.
- **Flask API** for real-time transaction scoring and fraud risk prediction.
- **Dynamic data simulation** for frontend/backend testing.

## Model Architecture

### ðŸ”¹ Autoencoder
- 5-layer encoder-decoder with ReLU and Dropout
- Trained to minimize MSE reconstruction loss
- Learns typical transaction patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Isolation Forest
- Trained on scaled feature vectors
- Detects rare isolation patterns in data
- Boosts ensembleâ€™s ability to generalize

### ðŸ”¹ Ensemble Scoring
- Final Score = `0.6 * AE Error + 0.4 * (1 - IF Score)`
- Threshold optimized via precision-recall F1 balance
